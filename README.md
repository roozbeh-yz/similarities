**ANALYZE SIMILARITIES IN IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION DATASETS USING WAVELETS AND SPECTRAL METHODS**


This code implements an algorithm for analyzing similarities in image datasets. The main idea, a formal algorithm, and its results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are presented in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10257.pdf

Below we explain some details of the algorithm.
